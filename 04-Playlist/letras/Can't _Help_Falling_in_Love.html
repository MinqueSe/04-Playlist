       <br> Wise men say
       <br> Only fools rush in
       <br> But I can't help falling in love with you
       <br> Shall I stay?
       <br> Would it be a sin
       <br> If I can't help falling in love with you?

       <br> Like a river flows
       <br> Surely to the sea
       <br> Darling, so it goes
       <br> Some things are meant to be

    </p>
    <p>
       <br> Take my hand
       <br> Take my whole life, too
       <br> For I can't help falling in love with you
