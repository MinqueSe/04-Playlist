         <br> Wise men say
         <br> Only fools rush in
         <br> But I can't help falling in love with you
         <br> Shall I stay?
         <br> Would it be a sin
         <br> If I can't help falling in love with you?
      </p>
      <p>
         <br> Like a river flows
         <br> Surely to the sea
         <br> Darling, so it goes
         <br> Some things are meant to be

      </p>
      <p>
         <br> Take my hand
         <br> Take my whole life, too
         <br> For I can't help falling in love with you
